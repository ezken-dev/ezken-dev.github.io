## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

Since this is a self-contained project, running it locally is incredibly simple.

1.  Download the repository files (`index.html`, `main.js`, `focus-pet.css`, etc.).
2.  Open `index.html` in any modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

<br>

## 🔮 Future Ideas

The "More features coming soon!" is just the beginning. Potential future updates include:

* More pet types (dragons, cats, etc.) and color customizations.
* An in-app "shop" to spend XP on pet accessories or new themes.
* A simple calculator or music player app.
* Deeper theme customization (accent colors, fonts).
* Saving user data to a remote backend instead of just `localStorage`.
